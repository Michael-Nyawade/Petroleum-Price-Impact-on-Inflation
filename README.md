# **THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IN PRICES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS ON INFLATION IN KENYA (A CASE STUDY OF NAIROBI COUNTY)**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to investigate the impact of fluctuations in petroleum prices on inflation within Kenya, with a specific focus on Nairobi County. Petroleum, a vital resource globally and particularly in Kenya, significantly influences various sectors including transportation and agriculture. The study delves into the intricate relationship between petroleum prices and inflation rates, analyzing data to model and forecast these dynamics. By examining the rate of change in petroleum prices over time and their correlation with inflation, the research seeks to provide insights into the economic implications of oil price fluctuations. Through empirical exploration, the project aims to answer key questions regarding the rate of change in petroleum prices, their relationship with inflation, and forecast future trends. The significance of the study lies in its potential to inform policy decisions aimed at stabilizing oil prices, mitigating inflationary pressures, and enhancing economic predictability. Furthermore, the project's scope encompasses three major petroleum products—kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—which are integral to both household consumption and industrial activities in Kenya. By utilizing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a metric, the study seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the broader economic implications of petroleum price changes on inflation, thereby contributing to informed decision-making processes in the energy and economic sectors of Kenya.
